## Appreciation

Thank you for taking the time to review my frontend engineering project for Lendsqr. It has been an exciting and rewarding experience to work on this assessment, and I believe it showcases my skills, dedication, and passion for frontend development.

Throughout the project, I have strived for visual fidelity, adhering closely to the provided Figma design. I have meticulously crafted each page, ensuring pixel-perfect representation and a seamless user experience. The codebase is well-structured, following best practices and utilizing modern technologies such as React with TypeScript and SCSS.

I have demonstrated my ability to integrate with a mock API, fetching user data and displaying it accurately on the User and User Details pages. By leveraging local storage, I have implemented a persistent storage solution to store and retrieve user details efficiently.

During the development process, I have paid careful attention to code quality, employing clean and maintainable coding practices. Unit testing has been an integral part of my approach, covering positive and negative scenarios to ensure robust functionality.

Moreover, I have maintained a clear and concise commit history, providing detailed commit messages that outline the purpose and impact of each change. The GitHub repository is well-documented, featuring a comprehensive README.md file that provides an overview of the project, instructions, and any necessary information.

As a frontend engineer, I understand the importance of responsive design, and I have ensured that the application adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes and media types. The project has been deployed on Vercel, allowing easy access for review.
